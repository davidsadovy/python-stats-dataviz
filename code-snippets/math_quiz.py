'''
This program can be used to generate simple arithmetic quizes for kids.
You can customize this program to suit the kids's level of math skills.
For example, change the maximum number of trials or the range of numbers.

You can also limit the kind of arithemetics. By default, the program randomly
pick from one of the four operations (add, subtract, multiple, divide) for each 
quiz. You can modify the question_list to limit the choices.
